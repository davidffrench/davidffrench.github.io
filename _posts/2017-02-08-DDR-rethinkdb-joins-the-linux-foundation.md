On October 5th 2016, it was announced that the company behind RethinkDB was shutting down. In the aftermath, RethinkDB was open sourced to keep it alive and it has just been announced that it is joining the linux foundation. This is great news for the longevity of the project and is a piece of mind for companies or individuals currently using it.
