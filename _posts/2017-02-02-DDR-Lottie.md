**What is Lottie:**

> Lottie is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, and allows native apps to use animations as easily as they use static assets. Lottie uses animation data exported as JSON files from an open-source After Effects extension called Bodymovin.

The only downside is that you need to use After Effects, which for some could mean learning a new tool.
